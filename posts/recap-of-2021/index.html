One of the most interesting things that I have noticed is that there was some sort of mental click towards the latter part of the year. It’s hard to describe but it feels like I have become more calm, patient, emotionally stable, and interestingly enough I am also more confident. Very neat.\nThe Good So here are the some of the good things that happened this year, in no particular order.\n I went on a week-long ski trip to Utah. Absolute blast and I hope to go back next year, hands down the best trip that I have ever been on. I went to see one of my favorite comedians perform. Very great time I laughed the entire time, Tim Dillon you are awesome. Passed all of my fall semester classes, and with much better grades than I had anticipated. In one of those classes in the fall semester, I had to really push my own coding abilities, and as a result I feel much more confident about my skills. With that mentioned the final push to get the project done for sure felt like eating glass and staring into the abyss, but overall it was a fun experience. I finally stopped caring so much about politics and ideology. This is something that has happened in the last 1-2 months but it feels good, the amount of political content I consumed was unhealthy. It felt very unhealthy because I was listening to probably 3-6 hours of podcasts most days, and then maybe 1 hour of scrolling twitter. When you’re listening to this much “news” it feels like you are just constantly being told that the other side is evil and that terrible things are always happening. And the worst part is all you can do is listen, there is practically nothing you can do to change it. There weren’t as many sad or down days compared to 2020 or 2019.  The not so good  On a general note, plenty of mistakes were made, things that I could have done differently. I lost a pretty significant amount of money in the stock market. Probably around $4,000, significant for me. If that isn’t bad enough, I also went through this crazy, fever dream-like state when my account dropped from around $3500 to under $250 in a matter of days. Lots of unnecessary turmoil and stress. Not too fun, but pretty funny in hindsight. I didn’t set myself up to be successful this last semester. The fact that my grades ended up being pretty good is a miracle. The last two weeks of school were nonstop 16-20 hour days of just studying for finals and completing projects. If I had just taken school more seriously from the start and just put in a little bit more effort throughout the semester, it would have been a lot less stressful. I did not stick to the goals that I set in the beginning of the year, I honestly cant remember what they are or where I wrote them down. My days didn’t have much structure and I did not have any periods of prolonged consistency. I did not go to the gym consistently at all. I wasted an ungodly amount of time on Tik Tok and Twitter, truly ungodly, I am scared to look. I think my average screen time on my phone was around 8-9 hours. Not too good.  I could probably write for hours talking about many more good and bad things that happened this year, but I think that is a long enough list as it is. While there are many bad things I could say about this year, I am happy that I learned many lessons and I know 2022 will be so much better than 2021.\nIn my next post I will write a little bit about what my plan and rules are for the next year.\n",
